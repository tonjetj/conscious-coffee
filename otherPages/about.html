            Conscious Coffee is a brand who focus on growing, burning, and
            selling organic coffee. We opened up our first caf√© in Fairytale
            Lane in 2018. Our philosophy is to keep making great coffee
            consciously, where we grow our coffee plants without all the nasty
            pesticides and chemicals - which is great for both our farmers AND
            our consumers!

          <h2>It's better for you!</h2>
          <p class="copy">
            Organic coffee has more nutrients than non-organic. Most people
            don't get enough of potassium, niacin or magnesium in their diet.
            Though the amount is small, any extra sources of these vital
            minerals are helpful. Organic coffee also contains vitamin B1, B2,
            B3 and B5.

            No pesticides means no danger in inhaling around the crops. Organic
            growing methods lets the farmer avoid working with poisons and
            pesticides.

          <p class="copy">
            Because organic coffee is of higher quality, the coffee farmers can
            charge more money for their product - which means that they can pay
            their workers a better wage.

            Organic farming is more eco-friendly in that it emits less carbon
            than chemical farming. Organic coffee is grown the natural way - in
            the shady, lush forests that provide homes and sustenance for
            indigenous plants, animals, and peoples.
